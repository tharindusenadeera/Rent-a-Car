      from San Diego would include a Maserati for under $150
      a day!!” We all know that LA is full of beautiful
      people but the cars were the real head truner for me
      on this trip! From the convenience of the car dropoff
      at my hotel to the pickup on my last day here, RYDE
      made my three-day stay in LA feel more like the life
      of a moviestar” I will definitely be using RYDE again
      on my next trip!`

      and since listing my Mercedes AMG on RYDE, I have
      earned approximately $700 a month which is sufficient
      to cover my lease payments when business is slow. I
      was considering getting another job to suppliment my
      income however with the side income that I earn from
      RYDE as a vehicle host, I no longer have to search for
      secondary employment”`

      Cayenne on RYDE at first since it is less than a year
      old and in pristine condition. However, the 1 million
      dollar coverage policy that RYDE provides is a
      guarantee not only of full wrap-around coverage but
      also complete peace of mind that the drivers who will
      be renting are responsible and dependable drivers.”`

      ways to impress new clients who come to Los Angeles to
      experience the glamour of the entertainment industry.
      Renting with RYDE is an affordable way to maximize the
      business of entertainment for my client relations
      while keeping to a modest budget!”`

      radio advertising with massive debt. Luxury is not in
      the cards for me with my two jobs and 3 roommates.
      When one of my friends recently told me about her
      amazing experience renting a BMW for a weekend for
      under $100 a day, I decided to treat myself to a
      similar experience as a birthday gift to myself. I am
      so glad I did! I rented a Porsche 911 for two days and
      one night and the memories will last a lifetime (as
      will my student debt!)“`

      car rental offices and filling out lengthy paperwork
      for hours only to receive a car that is so basic and
      unappealing that it looks like it belongs in a Sears
      ad. When I tried RYDE, I had a gorgeous 2016 BMW
      M-Series SUV at my hotel waiting for me in under an
      hour with the keys in my hand for only .“`
